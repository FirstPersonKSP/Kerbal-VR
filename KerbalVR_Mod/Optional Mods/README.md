# Scatterer

Install as normal, then copy the Scatterer directory from KerbalVR/Optional Mods on top of the one in your GameData directory and overwrite the existing files.

# Volumetric Clouds

If you have blackrack's volumetric clouds, install it as normal.  Then install the contents of one of the KerbalVR/OptionalMods/VolumetricClouds folders into GameData, overwriting any existing files.  Note that VolumetricClouds-v2 is empty; it does not need any special treatment.

# Optional VR patches

These can be placed anywhere in GameData.

## VR_disabletwist.cfg

Disables the twist axis on flightsticks, making it easier to control.  Note that you can swap the tilt left/right and twist axes by clicking the thumbstick on the controller while gripping the stick.

## VR_fullmotion.cfg

Tells steamVR to allow the fingers a full range of motion, which can be useful on some controller hardware.

## VR_human_hands.cfg

Uses human hands instead of Kerbal ones.
